# maze-chase
A simple game I worked on as an assignment in Next Generation Technologies 2.
Our lecturer gave us some code, and we had to finish it off so it worked.
I mainly wrote GameBoardNode and BadGuy, along with a bit of the other two classes.

The game involves a "bad guy" which chases the player around the play-area using the A* pathfinding algorithm.
Both before and during the game, the player can draw obstacles with the mouse to block the opponent.
A layout of these obstacles can be saved and loaded to and from the disk.
